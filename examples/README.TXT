The examples in this directory show how you can use pyRpc to
create a server application that exposes specific functions and
a client application that can call those functions with arguments
and get back a return value.

When using the client.py and server.py examples, it is important to
start the server.py first, and then start the client.py as it will
begin to communicate right away.

The clientGui and serverGui examples require PySide2 to be installed:
